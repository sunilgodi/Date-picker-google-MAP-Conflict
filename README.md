# Date-picker-google-MAP-Conflict
Date picker plugin is conflicting with google map plugin



After installing **cordova-plugin-googlemaps**  plugin **cordova-plugin-datepicker** is not working properly in iOS. basically the buttons (Done and cancel) are not responsive. We have to touch below (1cm offset) the button to react. And also some of the clicks are failing which we used in our HTML.
Below are the screenshots where buttons are not responding
